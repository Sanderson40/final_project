Final Project with Frogger

The game is a modern interpretation of the classic arcade game Frogger. 
Players take control of a cute frog and must guide it safely across a busy road and treacherous rivers to reach its destination. 
The game screen is divided into lanes, each filled with speeding cars or floating logs. The frog can move horizontally and vertically, avoiding collisions with vehicles and utilizing the logs as stepping stones to cross the rivers. 
With smooth graphics and intuitive controls, players must demonstrate quick reflexes and strategic thinking to navigate through increasingly challenging levels. 
The objective is to accumulate the highest score possible by successfully crossing the obstacles and reaching the destination. 
It's a test of skill, timing, and precision, offering an exciting and nostalgic gaming experience for players of all ages.
